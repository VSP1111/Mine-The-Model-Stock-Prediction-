Mine the Model is a Kaggle Competetion hosted by Cynaptics Club IIT Indore in collaboration with NJack IIT Patna . The competition revolves around bulding a stock prediction model. For the challenge , we used various deep learning models like Long Short Term Memory[LSTM], Simple Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs). The best model was LSTM with an error of 0.12%
